# TSL-KIT Documentation Framework

This directory mirrors the documentation structure defined in the TSLStudio comprehensive development plan. It contains empty categories and authoring templates that writers can duplicate when producing new content.

## Structure

- `api/` – Autogenerated reference output (leave empty; generated content only).
- `tutorials/` – Step-by-step walkthroughs; base new files on `templates/tutorial.md`.
- `examples/` – Complete runnable projects or code walkthroughs powered by the toolkit.
- `recipes/` – Focused problem/solution snippets for common tasks.
- `guides/` – Conceptual or architectural explanations.
- `templates/` – Source templates for each content type.

## Authoring Workflow

1. Copy the relevant template from `templates/` into the target folder.
2. Replace all placeholder tokens (`{{ ... }}`) with project-specific details.
3. Keep metadata blocks intact so future doc-generation tooling can parse tags.
4. When applicable, cross-link to API reference IDs exported from `@tslstudio/tsl` and `@tslstudio/engine`.
5. Add screenshots or media assets under `docs/assets/` (not yet created) and reference them with relative paths.

## Future Automation

The plan calls for automated API docs and code samples. Once the build tooling is wired, the `api/` directory will be populated by the generator. Until then, leave it empty to avoid merge conflicts.
